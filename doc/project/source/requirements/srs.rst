Software Requirements Specification
###################################

The SRS precisely defines the software product that will be built. Decisions made in writing the SRS are based on information in the :ref:`proposal` and :ref:`user_needs` documents. The SRS sets requirements that must be satisfied by the system design. The SRS is verified and validated by activities outlined in the :ref:`qa_plan`.

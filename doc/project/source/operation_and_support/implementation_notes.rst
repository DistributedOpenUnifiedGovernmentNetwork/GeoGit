Implementation Notes
####################

This document is a brief and fairly technical discussion of how the system works under ideal conditions. It is also known as a "theory of operation" document. It should describe key algorithms, technology dependencies, and operational issues. Much of the content of this document can be drawn from design documents. This document will be used by the QA, technical support, and operations groups. The goal is to give those groups the information they need to understand, manage, or begin to troubleshoot the system (i.e., recognize certain behavior as normal or abnormal). If significantly more information is needed, it should be organized into a larger "operations guide".

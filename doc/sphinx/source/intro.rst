Introduction
============

GeoGit is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) specially designed to handle geospatial data efficiently. It takes inspiration from the source code versioning system *git*, but has a different approach, best suited to the different nature of the data it manages. Users familiars with *git* should find it easy to use GeoGit, but reading this documentation is recommended, since some commands and ideas differ from the corresponding *git* ones. For users new to versioning systems, this document provides a complete description, and it does not assume the reader is familiar with any of such systems. Although these type of software, and particularly *git*, is originally used by programmers to manage their source code, this document is not targeted at programmers, and does not assume the reader has programming experience.

For those readers familiar with *git*, there are notes along the text that compare *git* and GeoGit and that will help you better understand the differences between both softwares. They look something like this:

.. note:: This is a note for *git* users

Users not familiar with *git* should skip notes like the one above.


How does GeoGit Works
---------------------

The following is a brief introduction to how GeoGit works and how it handles your data, and also how a GeoGit repository interacts with other repositories. These concepts will be explained in detail in the following sections, as we explain the corresponding commands that are used to set up a GeoGit repository and work on it.

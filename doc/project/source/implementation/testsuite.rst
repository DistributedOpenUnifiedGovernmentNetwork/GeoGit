Acceptance Tests Suite
######################

.. note:: This is a test suite for manual system testing. It is just one activity in the overall QA plan. A test case suite is simply a table of contents for the individual test cases. Organizing the suite of test cases by priority, functional area, actor, business object, or release can help identify parts of the system that need additional test cases.
